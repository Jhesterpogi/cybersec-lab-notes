# Hey there! I'm Jhester 👋

I'm a self-taught learner diving deep into the world of Information Security since 2023. While my main focus has been cybersecurity and ethical hacking, I also enjoy programming and building random side projects—some of which I did for clients after graduating with a degree in Information Technology.

Before shifting into cybersecurity, I worked as a freelance dev, then moved into the BPO industry as an IT Engineer. I later got promoted to a Level 2 Resolution Specialist under the Enterprise IT team. After almost 2 years in this role, I started teaching myself cybersecurity from scratch—starting with the basics of Linux, exploring distros like Ubuntu, and eventually getting hands-on with Kali Linux.

Currently, I’m just out here learning, breaking, building, and sharing what I can. Always open to new tech, challenges, and convos.
